# Galaxy Gym - Milestone Project One
The webpage is for a gym where a user can see the facilities available and classes at the gym. The user can book a gym membership and view the timetable for when the gym is open.
 
## UX
 
The UX process was to inform users of the facilities available at the gym. The user can browse the classes available and see the current opening hours for the gym. 

- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
- As a user type, I want to view the facilities available at the gym, so that I can know that it has what I require.
- As a user type, I want to view the opening hours of the gym, so that I can know if it is open when I have free time available.
- As a user type, I want to know what classes there are at the gym, so that I can join one that is suitable for my level of fitness.
- As a user type, I want to be able to book a membership, so that I can quickly use the gyms facilities.

No current wireframe available as I did not get familiar with using [Balsamiq](https://jquery.com) yet. 

## Features

## Technologies Used

Technologyies used in this website are:
- [HTML5]
    - The project uses **HTML5** to structure the website.
- [CSS]
    - The project uses **CSS** to try and style the background image of the banner.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** to make the website responsive on mobile and to quickly style the website.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** for the navbar dropdown and collapse.


## Testing

Testing was done in Google chrome developer tools. I tested the nav bar links to see if they were working. I also checked if the website was responsive. The website worked in google chrome and further testing will have to be done in internet explorer, safari and firefox to see if there are any problems in other browsers.

PROBLEMS
There was a problem with the css in which the backgroud image for the banner did not appear. The jumbrotrom's transperancy did not work.

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
The websit was deployed to Github.
